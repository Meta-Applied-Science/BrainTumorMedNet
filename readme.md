# RULE

## Naming Convention

1. Folder Name

- Use the formal snake_case rule.

- For `dts` folder, to respect the name of the dataset, we use the original folder name.

2. File Name

- Use the formal snake_case rule.

3. Variable Name

- Use the formal snake_case rule.

- Use the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants, global variables.

4. Branch Name in Git

- Use the formal kebab-case for branch name.

- Divide 4 main branch divided from `develop` branch:

    1. training

    2. evaluation

    3. CLI-building

    4. notebooks

- Separate the sub-branch from the main branch and assign it to the person responsible for the task.

    - ex: <main branch>/<developer>-<task name>
